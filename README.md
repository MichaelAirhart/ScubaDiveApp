### Purpose:
Dive Buddy is an app that scuba divers could use to search for dive sites in their area. The app will also display a host of data regarding that site, from water temperature to current wave conditions. Although there is no current database to pull for conditions under the water this app will continue to strive to proved the most up-to-date and accurate forcast for divers. 

### Technologies: 
- HTML 5
- CSS
- Bootstrap 4
- JavaScript
- React.JS
- Axios

### APIs: 
- googleapis - geocode & google maps
- api.divesites
- api.darksky
- api.stromglass

### Future Development
- Build out the user interface, provide a platform for divers to meet, chat, and share their diving experiences. 
- Develop methods to better predict underwater conditions (ie. underwater visablity). 
- Provide users with the tools to add their own details to each dive site (ie. provide updated conditions which the app itself may lack or be delayed, and provide details such as potential wildlife which may be at that site).
